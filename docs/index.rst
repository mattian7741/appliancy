Simple Microservice Development Framework
-----------------------------------------
Ergo is the substrate for the rapid development of coordinated microservices.

The primary emphasis with Ergo is to eliminate - as much as possible - the
boilerplate infrastructure that is common to most software stacks to 
facilitate a larger developer emphasis on business-oriented development.
This is achieved with inversion of control and procedural injection.
